### Hi there 👋

Hobbyist coder, blogger, and mass transit enthusiast. By day, I drive a city bus 🚍 around California's Central Valley. By night, I'm a computer code 🖥️ artisan. I can handle Git 🔀 just as well as I can handle a 40-foot bus 🚌.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: The ultimate Train Simulator experience for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, plus helping out with the @openrails free train simulator.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: The F# ecosystem and the Hugo static site generator.
- 💬 Ask me about: *Ace Attorney* and *Avatar: The Last Airbender* lore.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email address on my profile.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
